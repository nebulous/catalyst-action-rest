Mon  8 Feb 2010 22:17:12 GMT - Release 0.83
  Make it possible to deserialize a request with a DELETE method. This probably
  breaks 'strict' REST guidelines, but is useful for being able to delete multiple
  resources from a single call by providing a batch delete method.

  Remove JSONP from the list of default serializers (RT#54336)

  Fix MANIFEST (RT#54408)

Thu  4 Feb 2010 22:31:57 GMT - Release 0.82

  Integrated Catalyst::Request::REST::ForBrowsers as
  Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::ForBrowsers. (Dave Rolsky)

  Clarified docs so that they encourage the use of the request traits, rather
  than using Catalyst::Request::REST. (Dave Rolsky)

  When Catalyst::Action::REST or Controller::REST automatically add the trait,
  your request class will no longer end up getting set to
  Catalyst::Request::REST. Instead, creates an anon class with the appropriate
  role. (Dave Rolsky)

  Shut up log output from the tests. (Dave Rolsky)

  Added a $VERSION to every module, mostly to make sure that when people
  install Catalyst::Request::REST::ForBrowsers, they get the version in this
  distro. (Dave Rolsky)

  Change Catalyst::Action::Serialize, Catalyst::Action::Deserialize and
  Catalyst::Action::SerializeBase to be more Moose like.

  Fix JSON and JSON::XS to encode_blessed. (fREW)

  Fix Catalyst::Action::Serialize to use objects instead of classes. (fREW)

  Fix doc nits. (RT#53780)

  Add a JSONP serialization type.

Sat 19 Dec 14:54:00 GMT 2009 - Release 0.80

  the case of issues serializing the data (hobbs).

Fri 11 Dec 01:08:00 GMT 2009 - Release 0.79

  Cope with invalid (missing required q parameter) header like:
  application/json; charset="utf-8"

  Fix documentation to not mention deprecated things and generally be
  in better style.

  Make author information consistant and only in one module.

Mon 28 Sep 15:01:03 BST 2009 - Release 0.78

  Require Moose for the tests (RT#50066).

Thu 27 Aug 02:21:09 BST 2009 - Release 0.77

  Allow dispatching to Catalyst Actions, for use with ActionClasses
  etc - fREW

  Fix test if CATALYST_DEBUG environment variable is set

Fri Aug 21 21:20:52 BST 2009 - Release 0.76

  Added two new status response helpers (202 no content and 410 gone),
  and tests - Franck Cuny

Mon Aug 17 14:07:41 BST 2009 - Release 0.75

  Fix optional test failures in catalyst-action-serialize-accept.t

  Added a serializer for JSON::XS

  Made test independent of YAML::Syck bugs (dandv)

Wed Jul 22 23:49:16 BST 2009 (t0m) - Release 0.74

  Switch from NEXT to MRO::Compat (agladdish).

  Add display of additional REST actions in the stats, and also fix a warning
  in Catalyst 5.80 when you forward to another action from inside an
  action_FOO method (as it was confusing the stats).

  POD fixes

  Catalyst::Action::REST no longer @ISA Catalyst or Catalyst::Controller.

  Change constructor to call next::method instead of SUPER::

  Change method used to find the application class to be more correct

  Updated my contact information.
  Prepped for release.

Thu Jan  3 19:42:16 EST 2008
   Fixed RT#30498 - REST controller references Catalyst without
     loading it first.
   Fixed RT#32042 - Import of Params::Validate :all plays badly
     with subclasses that have their own validate()
   Fixed RT#30456 - Debug messages print even with debugging disabled

Thu Jan  3 08:54:09 PST 2008
   Fixed an issue where YAML::Syck versions 0.92 require $c->request->body to
     be stringified

Fri Dec 21 15:23:46 EDT 2007
   Updated the configuration specifiers to operate more in line with the way
   Catalyst expects.  Most notably component based configuration through
   "Controller::RestClass" now works.  "serialize" at the top level simply
   is suggested defaults that all REST classes inherit.

Wed Jul 04 11:17:20 EDT 2007
   Fixed 'default' serializer to set a valid Content-Type: header.  Fixes
   RT ticket 27949.  Note that behavior has changed -- the default
   serializer must now be specified as a content-type, not as a plugin
   name. (dmo@roaringpenguin.com)

Thu May 24 14:01:06 PDT 2007 (adam) - Release 0.41
   Moved a bogus $self->class to $c->component($self->class)

   Added some useful debugging. (drolsky)
   Added a View serializer/deserializer, which simply calls the correct
   Catalyst view.  ('text/html' => [ 'View', 'TT' ]) (claco, adam)

Wed Dec  6 00:45:02 PST 2006 (adam) - Release 0.31
   Fixed a bug where we would report a blank content-type negotiation.
   Added Data::Dump as a dependency.

Tue Dec  5 13:02:08 PST 2006 (adam)
   Made the YAML::HTML view automatically append content-type=text/html on
     the resulting URLs.

Sun Dec  3 12:24:16 PST 2006 (adam) - Release 0.30
   Updated the Makefile to support optional installation of the different
     Serialization formats.
   Renamed some of the test cases, since the execution order doesn't
     matter.
   Fixed things so that not having a Serialization module returns 415.
   Fixed things so that failure to Deserialize sends the proper status.
   Refactored the Plugin loading to Catalyst::Action::SerializeBase.
   Updated the Documentation.
   Added a whole raft of serializers. (JSON, all the Data::Serializer
     supported ones, and XML::Simple)
   Added test cases.

Thu Nov 30 23:51:04 PST 2006 (adam)
   Refactored the Catalyst::Action::REST dispatch, so that the default
     method is called before any _METHOD handlers.  In addition, moved
     the 405 Not Implemented handler to be foo_not_implemented, instead
     of the default sub.  (daisuke++ pointed out the inconsistency and
     provided a patch, and I added the foo_not_implemented support)

   Added in automated OPTIONS handler, which constructs the allow
     header for you, just like the 405 handler.  Can be overridden
     with a normal _METHOD sub.

   Refactored Test::Rest, so that it uses closures to create the
     very similar $test->method() subs.

   Added tests for Catalyst::Action::REST.

Thu Nov 30 17:14:51 PST 2006 (adam) - Release 0.2
   Added documentation patch from Daisuke Maki (daisuke@endeworks.jp)
   Added dependency patch from Daisuke Maki (daisuke@endeworks.jp)

Wed Oct 18 17:29:07 PDT 2006 (adam)
   Added more status_ helpers

Thu Oct 19 16:04:33 PDT 2006 (adam)
   Converted error helpers to return an object instead of plain-text.  It's
     a more consistent model than a text/plain error message.
   Added logging to 4xx status handlers
